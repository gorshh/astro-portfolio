Creating a typewriter animation in React seems simple at first. A few `setTimeout`s or `setInterval`s, a `useState` to hold the displayed text, and you're done, right?

Well, not quite.

Let me show you what happens when it goes wrong ‚Äî and how to fix it.

## The Feature: A Simple Typewriter Effect

The idea is straightforward: we want to display text character by character, like an old-school typewriter. This effect is perfect for building chat interfaces, GPT-style responses, or animated intros.

We built a hook like this:

```js
const useTypewriterFail = (text, speed = 1) => {
  const [displayText, setDisplayText] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    let i = 0;
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (i < text.length) {
        setDisplayText(prev => prev + text.charAt(i));
        i++;
      } else {
        clearInterval(interval);
      }
    }, speed);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [text, speed]);

  return { displayText };
};
```

It works‚Ä¶ kind of.

## The Bug: Missing Characters üòï

When using this hook in production or with multiple pieces of text (like GPT-style responses), you might notice something weird:

- Some characters just **don‚Äôt appear**.
- Often it‚Äôs the **second character**.
- Sometimes it happens only after changing the `text`.

Here‚Äôs an actual example reported on Stack Overflow:

> ‚ÄúWhen I type out the string 'tarot card...', it shows as 'trot card...' ‚Äî the **a** is missing.‚Äù

You read that right. It wasn‚Äôt a typo ‚Äî it was a **state management bug**.

---

## Why This Happens: State Batching and Async Timing

The bug comes down to **how React batches state updates**.

In the broken hook, we use this line inside a loop:

```js
setDisplayText(prev => prev + text.charAt(i));
```

But React doesn‚Äôt guarantee immediate updates for state. So if `setDisplayText` is called rapidly (like in fast intervals), and `i` is being incremented at the same time, there‚Äôs a race condition. The `prev` might be stale, or the `i` might jump by two. The result? Skipped letters.

---

## The Fix: Use Refs for Precision

We solve this by using **refs** instead of relying only on `useState`. Refs are synchronous and not affected by batching.

Here‚Äôs the improved version:

```js
const useTypewriter = (text, speed = 50) => {
  const [displayText, setDisplayText] = useState('');
  const index = useRef(0);
  const currentText = useRef('');

  useEffect(() => {
    index.current = 0;
    currentText.current = '';
    setDisplayText('');

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (index.current < text.length) {
        currentText.current += text.charAt(index.current);
        setDisplayText(currentText.current);
        index.current++;
      } else {
        clearInterval(interval);
      }
    }, speed);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [text, speed]);

  return { displayText };
};
```

### Why it works:
- `index` and `currentText` are refs, so they persist between renders without triggering re-renders.
- State (`displayText`) is updated cleanly, using the accumulated `currentText`.

## Bonus: Multiple Responses in a Row

If you're rendering multiple responses (like in a chat UI), make sure you don‚Äôt share the same state or index between them. Each text needs its own hook instance or its own isolated typing context.

---

## Final Thoughts

React is powerful, but with that power comes caveats. Timing, batching, and async state updates can trip you up in subtle ways ‚Äî especially in animations like this.

So if your text starts skipping letters like a haunted typewriter... don‚Äôt panic. Just bring in a few `useRef`s, and everything will type out beautifully. üßµ‚å®Ô∏è
